🤝 Contributing Guide
Thank you for your interest in improving Academic Hub! Your help is valued — whether you contribute code, documentation, designs, or ideas. This guide explains how to get started, what we expect from contributors, and how to make your first PR successful.

🧭 Quick overview
Fork the repo, create a branch, make small focused changes, and open a PR.

See GOOD_FIRST_ISSUES.md for bite-sized tasks.

Read our CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md and follow it.

🍴 How to contribute (step-by-step)
1) Fork the repository
Click the Fork button in the top-right of the repository page.

2) Clone your fork
Bash

# HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/unkeett/academic-hub.git
cd academic-hub

# or SSH
git clone git@github.com:unkeett/academic-hub.git
cd academic-hub
3) Create a feature branch
Always create a branch for your work:

Bash

git checkout -b feat/short-description
# or
git checkout -b fix/short-description
4) Make changes and commit
Keep changes focused (one feature/fix per PR).

Follow the existing code style.

Use sensible commit messages (imperative tense):

Bash

git add .
git commit -m "feat(notes): add search functionality"
5) Test locally
Run the project locally to ensure nothing broke:

Bash
cd frontend
npm run start
cd backend
node server.js

6) Push your branch and open a PR
Bash

git push -u origin feat/short-description
Go to GitHub → your fork → Compare & pull request → pick the upstream main as the base and write a clear description.

✅ Pull request checklist (what we expect in a good PR)
[ ] PR has a clear title and description explaining why the change is needed.

[ ] Changes are small and focused.

[ ] Code compiles and runs without errors.

[ ] Added or updated documentation when applicable.

[ ] All tests (if any) pass locally.

[ ] No sensitive information (API keys, passwords) committed.

💡 What you can work on (ideas & good first issues)
Add a new resource (e.g., a link, a PDF, or notes) to an existing subject.

Improve the UI for displaying course materials.

Fix a typo in the documentation or a resource description.

Implement a search or filter functionality for resources.

🧰 Development setup (recommended)
Install dependencies: pnpm install (or npm install).

Create .env.local from .env.example and fill secrets (do not commit).

Start dev server: pnpm dev (or npm run dev).

If you prefer Docker or have a local database, include instructions in README.md.

🧑‍⚖️ Code style & commit conventions
Use TypeScript for new code where possible.

Keep formatting consistent (Prettier recommended).

Commit messages: use conventional-ish format e.g. feat:, fix:, docs:.

👩‍🏫 Reviewing process & maintainers
Maintainers will review PRs and request changes if needed.

Be responsive to review comments — small changes help fast merges.

If maintainers agree a PR is valid but cannot merge, they may tag it hacktoberfest-accepted.

🛡 Security & sensitive data
Never add secrets, passwords, or private keys to the repo.

If you discover a security issue, contact the maintainers privately (see SECURITY.md if present).

📬 Contact & support
Open an issue for help or discussion.

Join repository Discussions (if enabled) for broader conversation.
